# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

MemoryVault AI is a **full-featured local AI assistant** with persistent memory, being built through a **4-phase learning methodology** to avoid tutorial hell and ensure deep understanding. The project provides a **ChatGPT-like experience** that runs 100% locally with memory that persists across sessions.

**Target Capabilities:**

- General-purpose AI conversation and assistance
- Coding mentor and pair programming partner
- Document processing and intelligent search
- Web research and information retrieval
- Academic assistance (study help, note-taking, etc.)
- VSCode integration for development workflow

**Current Status: Phase 1 - "Memory That Actually Works"**

## Learning Methodology

### Anti-Tutorial Hell Approach

- **Problem-First**: Each phase solves a real frustration
- **Immediate Usage**: Build tools actually used for real work
- **Understanding Checkpoints**: Student explains WHY before advancing
- **Your Code**: Student writes code with guidance, no copy-paste
- **Progressive Complexity**: Start simple, add complexity when pain emerges

### 4-Phase Development Plan

#### **Phase 1: "Memory That Actually Works" (CURRENT)**

**Problem**: AI conversations disappear every restart, losing valuable context

- Build terminal chat using existing `memory_manager.py`
- **Value**: AI assistant that remembers across sessions
- **Learning**: Context management, data persistence fundamentals

#### **Phase 2: "Documents That Answer Questions" (NEXT)**

**Problem**: Information scattered across files, can't query effectively

- Add document processing to existing structure
- **Value**: AI that knows your documents and can answer questions about them
- **Learning**: Knowledge representation, retrieval systems, document processing

#### **Phase 3: "Specialized Assistant" (FUTURE)**

**Problem**: Generic responses don't leverage your specific context/workflow

- Build domain-specific behavior and response patterns
- **Value**: AI that adapts to your work style and preferences
- **Learning**: System design, specialization, user modeling

#### **Phase 4: "Production AI Assistant" (FINAL)**

**Problem**: Need competitive alternative to ChatGPT with better memory

- Integrate real LLM into proven architecture
- **Value**: Full-featured AI assistant with web UI and VSCode integration
- **Learning**: Modern AI architecture, RAG systems, production deployment

## Architecture Patterns & Design Principles

### Clean Architecture Requirements

- **Core Logic Independence**: Business logic must not depend on UI, frameworks, or external systems
- **Dependency Inversion**: High-level modules should not depend on low-level modules. Both should depend on abstractions
- **Interface Segregation**: No component should depend on interfaces it doesn't use
- **Single Responsibility**: Each class/module has one reason to change

### Layer Separation Rules

```
üì± Presentation Layer     (Terminal, Web UI, VSCode Extension)
    ‚Üì (depends on)
üß† Application Layer      (Chat orchestration, conversation flow)
    ‚Üì (depends on)
üíº Domain Layer          (Core AI logic, memory management, document processing)
    ‚Üì (depends on)
üîß Infrastructure Layer   (File I/O, LLM APIs, vector databases)
```

### Key Patterns to Follow

#### **Repository Pattern**

- Memory persistence should be abstracted behind interfaces
- Core logic shouldn't know if memory is JSON, database, or cloud storage

#### **Strategy Pattern**

- AI response generation should be pluggable
- Core logic shouldn't care if responses come from local LLM, API, or mock responses

#### **Command Pattern**

- User actions should be encapsulated as commands
- Makes undo/redo, logging, and multiple UIs easier

#### **Observer Pattern**

- UI should observe core state changes
- Enables real-time updates across multiple interface types

### Implementation Guidelines

1. **Core classes never import UI libraries** - No Streamlit, tkinter, etc. in business logic
2. **Interfaces define contracts** - Use Python protocols/ABC for clean boundaries
3. **Dependency injection** - Core logic receives its dependencies, doesn't create them
4. **Pure functions where possible** - Easier to test and reason about

### Test-Driven Development (TDD) Requirements

#### TDD Cycle (Red-Green-Refactor)

1. **Red**: Write a failing test that describes desired behavior
2. **Green**: Write minimal code to make the test pass
3. **Refactor**: Improve code quality while keeping tests green

#### TDD Benefits for Learning

- **Forces clear requirements** - Can't write test without understanding what you're building
- **Prevents over-engineering** - Only build what the test requires
- **Validates understanding** - Test describes your mental model
- **Enables confident refactoring** - Architecture changes don't break functionality

#### Testing Strategy by Layer

```
üß™ Unit Tests        ‚Üí Domain layer (ChatEngine, MemoryManager)
üîÑ Integration Tests ‚Üí Application layer (components working together)
üñ•Ô∏è E2E Tests         ‚Üí Presentation layer (full user workflows)
```

#### Phase 1 TDD Focus

- **Test first, code second** - Write test describing chat behavior before implementing
- **Start with simplest test** - "ChatEngine can accept a message"
- **One test at a time** - Don't write multiple tests until current one passes
- **Test the interface, not implementation** - Test what ChatEngine does, not how

#### Testing Tools & Standards

```bash
# Run tests (always before committing)
python -m pytest

# Run with coverage
python -m pytest --cov=.

# Test specific module
python -m pytest tests/test_chat_engine.py
```

### Phase 1 Architecture Focus

- Build **ChatEngine** as pure business logic (no UI dependencies)
- **MemoryManager** already follows this pattern ‚úÖ
- **Terminal interface** should be thin adapter that calls ChatEngine
- All user input/output handled by presentation layer only

## Current Components (Phase 1)

### Memory Management (`memory_manager.py`) ‚úÖ WORKING

- **Purpose**: Handles persistent conversation storage and retrieval
- **Features**: Session management, message storage, conversation search
- **Storage**: JSON-based persistence in `memory/conversation_memory.json`
- **Status**: Tested and functional

### Terminal Chat Interface (IN PROGRESS)

- **Purpose**: Full-featured chat interface with AI assistant capabilities
- **Goal**: Prove memory persistence works for real AI conversations
- **Usage**: General AI assistance, coding help, document queries, etc.

### Future Components (Later Phases)

- Document processing and search (Phase 2)
- Web interface with ChatGPT-like UI (Phase 3-4)
- VSCode integration for coding assistance (Phase 4)
- LLM integration with local models (Phase 4)

### Success Criteria for Phase 1

1. **Functional terminal chat** that saves/loads conversations across sessions
2. **Daily usage** for coding questions, problem-solving, general assistance
3. **Understanding checkpoint** - student explains WHY persistent memory transforms AI interaction
4. **Pain identification** - what limitations drive the need for document processing (Phase 2)

## Development Workflow (Simplified for Learning)

### Git Workflow

```bash
# Current branch (Phase 1)
git checkout phase-1-memory-chat

# Simple commit process
git add filename.py
git commit -m "Phase 1: Add terminal chat interface"
```

### Quality Standards (Learning-Appropriate)

- **Test-driven development** - Write tests first to clarify requirements
- Code that works and solves the real problem
- Basic error handling for user experience
- Clear, readable code that student understands
- **Clean architecture** - UI-agnostic core logic with proper separation
- Functional testing through actual daily usage

## Important Notes for Claude Code

- **Stay in Phase 1** - Don't suggest advanced features until this phase is complete
- **Full AI assistant scope** - This isn't just note-taking, it's a complete AI assistant
- **Architecture-first thinking** - Always guide toward clean separation of concerns
- **UI-agnostic core logic** - Business logic should never depend on presentation layer
- **TDD methodology** - Guide student to write tests first, then implement
- **Test-driven learning** - Use tests to validate understanding before building
- **Problem-first guidance** - Always explain WHY before HOW architecturally
- **Student codes** - Provide guidance and architectural thinking, not complete solutions
- **Check understanding** - Ask student to explain architectural decisions before advancing
- **Design patterns** - Guide toward proper use of Repository, Strategy, Command patterns
- **Real usage focus** - Build for actual AI assistant workflows (coding help, problem-solving, etc.)

## Learning Checkpoints

Before advancing to Phase 2, student must:

1. ‚úÖ Demonstrate terminal chat being used for real AI assistance tasks
2. ‚úÖ Explain WHY persistent memory changes the AI assistant experience
3. ‚úÖ Identify pain points that document processing would solve
4. ‚úÖ Walk through memory_manager.py code and architecture decisions

---

**Current Priority**: Build terminal chat interface for full AI assistant functionality with persistent memory.
